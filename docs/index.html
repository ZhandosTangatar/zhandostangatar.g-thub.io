                    The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel by the English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, 
                    the world at some distant time in the past, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit,
                    but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, 
                    The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.
